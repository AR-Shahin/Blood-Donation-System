<h1 align="center">Blood Donation System</h1>


## About Project
In this project, I've developed a blood donation system where user can search blood easily.Our Blood Donation System or BDS offers a system that solves a critical problem in critical times. It becomes a fearsome situation when blood is needed for a patient and the blood cannot be found anywhere. Especially when the type of the blood is rare. By spreading our system throughout the country, we hope to be able to greatly reduce the number of deaths caused by the lack of blood. 

## Goal of this Project
- Our project is initialized having some main goals in mind. These are:
- Create a reliable stable system which can handle all possible situations
- Expand our system to other platforms and increase reachability.
- Greatly decrease the helplessness and worries of the patient’s family.
- Greatly decrease the death rate caused by the lack of blood donation
- Motivate and inspire people to donate blood
- Make our team big and offer some work opportunities
- Spread our system across the country and help people from all around the country.

## Problem Statement
The current system of our country is not that useful and efficient. People look and search for blood manually by themselves. They contact as many people as possible for blood, which is very time consuming. Then many people try to get help from blood banks which are not that technologically advanced in our country. Most blood banks don't have any kind of database system by which they can maintain and manage their bloods. They manage their blood manually which is time consuming. Even if some blood banks do have any database system to manage their bloods, they’re often not properly maintained or updated. As multiple blood banks have their own separate database system, it’s not a centralized system. so, it's not well made. Even if someone is able to manage blood, sometimes it results in a more critical condition. Sometimes, the managed blood can be impure. which can result in a worse situation for the patient. There are many reasons why a person cannot donate blood and most of them don’t know them.For example: Cancer, Cardiac disease, Severe lung disease, Hepatitis B patient cannot donate blood. So, they donate blood without knowing that they’re not allowed to donate blood. Thousands of patients die because of impure or unhealthy blood donation.
